***Run as many as infinite robots*** :robot: ***on your desktop. Powered by Node Red.***

Maya Desktop allows you manage your own mighty fleet of Node Red robots to run parallely on you device and have it managed easily through a simple dashboard. 

We are bringing in features to collaborate over building bots, sharing and monetize them soon. Stay tuned on that.

We are released for Linux with AppImage binary. To download head over to github [releases](https://github.com/mayahq/maya-desktop/releases) and get yourself the latest version of Maya Desktop.

Alternatively you can use your linux terminal to do the same.
